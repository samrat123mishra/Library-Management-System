		"bookid": "b004",
		"bookicon": "images/book-icon-4.jpg",
		"bookinfo": "This textbook is a classical and well-written introduction to probability theory and statistics. the book is written ‘for an audience such as computer science students, whose mathematical background is not very strong and who do not need the detail and mathematical depth of similar books written for mathematics or statistics majors.’ … Each new concept is clearly explained and is followed by many detailed examples. … numerous examples of calculations are given and proofs are well-detailed.(Sophie Lemaire, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2008 m).Categorical data is data that records categories. Examples could be, a survey that records whether a person is for or against a proposition. Or, a police force might keep track of the race of the individuals they pull over onthe highway. The U.S. census (http://www.census.gov), which takes place every 10 years, asks several different questions of a categorical nature. Again, there was one on race which in the year 2000 included 15 categories with write-in space for 3 more for this variable (you could mark yourself as multi-racial). Another example, might be a doctor’s chart which records data on a patient. The gender or the history of illnesses might be treated as categories.Continuing the doctor example, the age of a person and their weight are numeric quantities. The age is a discrete numeric quantity (typically) and the weight as well (most people don’t say they are 4.673 years old). These numbers are usually reported as integers. If one really needed to know precisely, then they could in theory take on a continuum of values, and we would consider them to be continuous. Why the distinction? In data sets, and some tests it is important to know if the data can have ties (two or more data points with the same value). For discrete data it is true, for continuous data, it is generally not true that there can be ties.A simple, intuitive way to keep track of these is to ask what is the mean (average)? If it doesn’t make sense then the data is categorical (such as the average of a non-smoker and a smoker), if it makes sense, but might not be an answer (such as 18.5 for age when you only record integers integer) then the data is discrete otherwise it is likely to be continuous."

		"bookinfo": "If you are a scientist on your way to sign a consulting contract with a biotechnology or pharmaceutical company, hold on. You should first read Biomedical Consulting Agreements: A Guide for Academics by Edward Klees and H. Robert Horvitz. Even if your contract looks great because you have been offered a great deal of shares or it does not require too much time for you, there may well be a catch. Have you ever heard about antidilution rights? Are you sure you understand the confidentiality obligations or the intellectual property rights?This book will tell you about all sorts of useful things that you should be looking for before signing a contract. The book is short, to the point, and perfectly organized in small parts to allow you to quickly find an answer to the particular question you have (and even a few questions you don’t).After reading this book, you may still need to ask advice from a specialist like a lawyer or someone from your university for the more complex cases, but Klees and Horvitz will help you speak the same language and ask the right questions.However, if you are not about to sign a contract but perhaps are looking for general information about consulting for companies, I do not recommend this book. Biomedical Consulting Agreements will not tell you about relationships between academia and industry or how to get an offer from the business sector.The book is targeted for someone who is in academia and has, or soon will have, an offer from a company to do some consulting work (from a couple of hours to a lot more). It is intended to help you understand the contract and hopefully help you avoid giving away multi-billion rights from you and your university."

		"bookinfo": "This book is important because it is the first textbook in an area that has become very popular in recent times. There are around 250 research groups in crystal engineering worldwide today. The subject has been researched for around 40 years but there is still no textbook at the level of senior undergraduates and beginning PhD students. This book is expected to fill this gap.The writing style is simple, with an adequate number of exercises and problems, and the diagrams are easy to understand. This book consists major areas of the subject, including organic crystals and co-ordination polymers, and can easily form the basis of a 30 to 40 lecture course for senior undergraduates."

Tanenbaum takes a structured approach to explaining how networks work from the inside out. He starts with an explanation of the physical layer of networking, computer hardware and transmission systems; then works his way up to network applications. Tanenbaum's in-depth application coverage includes email; the domain name system; the World Wide Web (both client- and server-side); and multimedia (including voice over IP, Internet radio video on demand, video conferencing, and streaming media. Each chapter follows a consistent approach: Tanenbaum presents key principles, then illustrates them utilizing real-world example networks that run through the entire book—the Internet, and wireless networks, including Wireless LANs, broadband wireless and Bluetooth. The Fifth Edition includes a chapter devoted exclusively to network security. The textbook is supplemented by a Solutions Manual, as well as a Website containing PowerPoint slides, art in various forms, and other tools for instruction, including a protocol simulator whereby students can develop and test their own network protocols."
